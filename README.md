### How I approached the project, what I liked, what I didnâ€™t like, and where you faced issues
- First of all I found the UI design of the app to be particularly impressive. 
- What I liked the most was implementing the horizontal galleries and the ocean video background, which I found to be quite satisfying. 
- I did face some struggles with implementing the animations, but managed to do most of them.
- During my work on the project, I was able to fully implement all of the pages within the homepage. However, I must note that there are some missing features that I am aware of and that I didn't manage to finish due to the deadline, and I am sure that they will be noticed. 
- The main thing that i regret is that I, unfortunately, was not able to fully achieve the level of responsiveness that we had hoped for. I made the mistake in the beginning because I didn't follow the "mobile first approach" and I thought that I would have time to make it fully responsive later. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and I understand that this may have impacted your experience with the app.
I want to assure you that I did my best to make the app responsive across all devices, but due to the deadline I wasn't able to achieve everything that we had planned for. I take full responsibility for this and I will continue to work on improving the app's responsiveness in the future, after the review of course.
- In the end, I must say that I am satisfied with the outcome and the quality of work that I was able to produce. I must emphasize that this is one of the most enjoyable projects that I have had the pleasure of working on.

### Estimated time for the task:
- I was assigned the task last Wednesday and have been actively working on it for the past five days. As of now, it is after midnight on Wednesday, and I anticipate finishing the task shortly, essentially completing it on Thursday morning.
