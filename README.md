- `Material UI` used as design framework (version 5.12.0)
- `ESlint` used for formatting, coding standards etc

### How I approached the project, what I liked, what I didnâ€™t like, and where you faced issues
- First of all I found the UI design of the app to be particularly impressive. What I liked the most was implementing the horizontal galleries and the ocean video background, which I found to be quite satisfying. 
- I did face some struggles with implementing the animations, but managed to do most of them.
- During my work on the project, I was able to fully implement all of the pages within the homepage. However, I must note that there are some missing features that I am aware of and that I didn't manage to finish due to the deadline, and I am sure that they will be noticed. 
- In the end, I must say that I am extremely satisfied with the outcome and the quality of work that I was able to produce. I must emphasize that this is one of the most enjoyable projects that I have had the pleasure of working on.

### Estimated time for the task:
- I was assigned the task last Wednesday and have been actively working on it for the past five days. As of now, it is after midnight on Wednesday, and I anticipate finishing the task shortly, essentially completing it on Thursday morning.
